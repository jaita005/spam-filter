## Description
A simple **Spam Detection Web App** built with **Python, Flask, and Logistic Regression**.  
This project trains a model to classify text messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**, and provides a web interface to test your messages.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression  

- Logistic Regression is used as a lightweight machine learning model for binary classification.  
- It learns from message features (words) and predicts the probability of a message being **Spam** or **Ham**.
